# Colors Extractor

## Overview

A personal tool I developed to extract color values from MD files. So far, it only works when the color information are structured in a specific format like the ones from Frontend Mentor projects. Make sure to see the file called "style-guide" in the assets folder.

## Installation

1. Install TypeScript, if you haven't already.
2. Run the following command inside the folder: ```npm run start```
